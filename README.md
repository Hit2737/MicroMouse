# MicroMouse
Given material is of the Project Course ME299 that I did with my friend Shaury Patel under Prof. Aniruddh Mali at IIT Gandhinagar
We made an Autonomous Maze Solving Micromouse bot based on the flood fill algorithm using ESP32 micro processor
The Repository contains all the files of ideation, planning and implementation of the Micromouse that we made during the project
The major components that we used in this project are:
1. ESP32 Micro Processor
2. L298N Motor Driver
3. N20 Encoder Motors
4. IR Sensors
